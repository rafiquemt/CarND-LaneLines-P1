    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "It was reasonably easy to get started with this project. The already filled out stubs made it easier to focus on tuning and the high level pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning of parameters could be done in a better way. maybe a gui to help tweak the parameters and get immediate feedback on the various stages of the pipeline would help give more intuition on the impact of parameters. Additionally a broader data set of initial images with different road / lightning conditions would help to tune better\n",
    "\n",
    "The region mask could be more restricted to minimize noise from debris or patches on the road between the lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial approach to convert rgb to grayscale resulted in certain colors just blending into the road and made it harder to find lines for the challenge. Switched to something like HSV to average the colors and relied on the V value as the grayscale image. \n",

    "Smoothing of the lines\n",
    "The lines tend to jump around some times. Also in certain frames for the challenge, I was unable to find lines. This could be resolved by keeping averaging the lines found from previous few frames. This would give a more stable output and prevent the lines from jumping around or completely disappearing at times.\n",

    "### When can it fail\n",
    "This can fail under the following scenarios \n",
    "* other lines and signs written on the road between the lane. can cause false lines to be found\n",
    "* may not really work well when changing lanes. \n",
    "* structures or debris on the road can cause lines to be mixed up\n",
    "* If the roads have a sharp curve then this algorithm can fail. Probably works well for gradual curves on highways\n",
    "* Don't know what happens at night time in lower light conditions\n",
    "* We're assuming that the camera is on a stable mount, but what happens when the camera shifts from its mount"
